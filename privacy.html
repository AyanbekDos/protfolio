      <h1>Unified Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>This document explains how Ayanbek Dosumbaev (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, shares, and protects personal data across every digital product, landing page, automation, analytics dashboard, bot, or consulting engagement currently operated under the Ayanbek Dosumbaev brand, including but not limited to WhatsApp Business flows, LinkedIn API integrations, Telegram or email automations, AI assistants, and public websites.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Who Is Responsible</h2>
      <p>Ayanbek Dosumbaev acts as the data controller for information collected directly via our websites, forms, communication channels, and self-serve tools. When we operate white-label automations or handle your customer data under a separate contract, we act as a data processor and process that data strictly under your documented instructions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Scope of Services Covered</h2>
      <p>This policy automatically covers every current and future property unless another document explicitly replaces it. The scope includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Marketing sites, landing pages, waitlists, and intake forms hosted on <strong>smetai.online</strong>, <strong>ayanbek.ai</strong>, GitHub Pages, or custom domains.</li>
        <li>WhatsApp Business applications, chatbots, notification templates, and CRM automations powered by Meta’s WhatsApp Business Platform.</li>
        <li>LinkedIn API or Sales Navigator integrations used for prospecting, data enrichment, or analytics.</li>
        <li>Email campaigns, transactional messaging, and newsletter automations (“Rasylka”).</li>
        <li>AI copilots, Telegram bots, data-room dashboards, and private customer portals built during consulting engagements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you reuse this link for an additional project, it inherits this policy automatically.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>The exact categories depend on the service you use, but may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account and identity data:</strong> name, username, job title, profile photo, verified phone numbers, social media profile URLs, government-issued IDs (where KYC is required).</li>
        <li><strong>Contact details:</strong> email address, phone, messaging handles, company address, billing contact, preferred language.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications and content:</strong> WhatsApp/Telegram conversations, LinkedIn messages, uploaded files, AI prompts, meeting notes, and attachments generated or stored through the solutions you enable.</li>
        <li><strong>Business context:</strong> CRM identifiers, pipeline data, purchase history, segmentation labels, support tickets, and automation preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage and diagnostics:</strong> device metadata, browser/OS, IP address, cookies, log files, API payloads, message delivery receipts, error traces, and analytics events used to secure and debug the service.</li>
        <li><strong>Transactional data:</strong> invoices, payment confirmations, tax details, and contractual documentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We avoid collecting sensitive categories unless they are part of a specific use case you authorize (for example, healthcare documents for OCR automation). When sensitive data is unavoidable, it is handled under stricter access controls and, where required, with additional agreements or consent.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. How and Why We Use Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Deliver requested functionality (message routing, AI responses, dashboards, analytics, onboarding flows).</li>
        <li>Configure, monitor, and optimize automations tailored to your workflows.</li>
        <li>Provide customer support, incident response, and success enablement.</li>
        <li>Improve reliability and performance, including testing new features with aggregated or anonymized metrics.</li>
        <li>Prevent spam, fraud, account takeovers, and misuse of Meta/LinkedIn policies.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal, tax, and law-enforcement obligations.</li>
        <li>Send administrative communications, invoices, and — where permitted — product updates or marketing. You can unsubscribe from marketing at any time.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Legal Bases for Processing</h2>
      <p>When the GDPR or similar laws apply, we rely on one or more of these legal bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contract performance:</strong> processing is necessary to provide the services you requested.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> safeguarding platforms, improving products, or pursuing commercial opportunities without overriding your rights.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> required for optional analytics, marketing subscriptions, or processing special-category data.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> bookkeeping, anti-fraud checks, or responding to lawful requests.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Sharing and Disclosures</h2>
      <p>We never sell personal data. We only share information under controlled circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure vendors:</strong> hosting, storage, analytics, ticketing, and monitoring platforms that operate under confidentiality and data-processing agreements.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform partners:</strong> Meta/WhatsApp, LinkedIn, email service providers, telecom carriers, and payment processors as required to execute the workflows you configure.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise customers:</strong> if we act as a processor, your admins control access and exports inside the workspace.</li>
        <li><strong>Advisors:</strong> legal, accounting, or security consultants under contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Authorities:</strong> regulators, courts, or law enforcement when legally compelled. We push back on overly broad requests and notify you when allowed by law.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>Data may be processed in Kazakhstan, the European Union, the United States, or other jurisdictions where we or our providers operate. We use Standard Contractual Clauses, intra-company agreements, or other recognized safeguards to protect data transferred out of the EEA, UK, or Switzerland.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described above or as required by law:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Default retention for conversation logs and analytics is 12 months, unless you configure a different policy inside your workspace.</li>
        <li>Contracts, invoices, and compliance records are stored for up to 7 years (or longer if local law requires).</li>
        <li>Backups are cycled on rolling schedules, and deletion requests propagate to backups within 30–45 days.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can request earlier deletion of specific channels, automations, or entire tenants; we fulfill verified requests within 30 days unless retention laws prevent it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Security</h2>
      <p>We apply layered safeguards: encryption in transit and at rest, strict access controls with MFA, network segmentation, continuous monitoring, vulnerability scanning, penetration tests, and incident-response playbooks. Staff and contractors receive confidentiality and security training. If a breach impacts your data, you will be notified without undue delay together with remediation steps.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
      <p>Web properties may use first-party cookies, local storage, or similar technologies for authentication, load balancing, and analytics. You can control cookies through your browser settings. Where law requires opt-in consent (e.g., in the EU), a banner or in-product control will be presented before non-essential cookies load.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access, correct, or update your personal data.</li>
        <li>Request deletion or anonymization.</li>
        <li>Restrict or object to certain processing activities.</li>
        <li>Receive a portable copy of your data in a structured format.</li>
        <li>Opt out of marketing communications.</li>
        <li>Appeal or lodge a complaint with your local data-protection authority.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12. Children’s Data</h2>
      <p>Our services target business users and are not intended for children under 16 or the age defined by local law. We do not knowingly collect data from minors. If you believe a child provided us with information, contact us and we will delete it promptly.</p>
    </section>
